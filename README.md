# GPT Vision Chat ‚Äì A Friendly Desktop Companion

## Hey there, fellow explorers of GPT! üöÄ

I've put together a little side project called **GPT Vision Chat**. Think of it as a casual chat with GPT-4, but from the comfort of your desktop and with a cool twist: the ability to throw in images! Yep, now asking questions about those pesky screenshots or any visual puzzles is just a click or a hotkey away.

## What's This All About? ü§î

Ever been knee-deep in work and stumbled upon an error message as cryptic as an ancient manuscript? Or maybe you've had a math equation staring at you from a photo, begging to be solved. Instead of tab-hopping and website navigating, why not just press a key, snag a screenshot, and get querying? That's the convenience GPT Vision Chat brings to your desktop!

## Features (The Cool Bits) üéâ

- **Chat with GPT-4**: Just type in your question and voil√† ‚Äì wisdom from GPT-4.
- **Screenshot Magic**: Capture your screen's content and let GPT-4 do the heavy lifting.
- **Lazy Loading**: Queue up those screenshots and fire away all your queries at once.
- **Shortcut Simplicity**: Hit Ctrl+P and your screenshot is ready to be analyzed.
- **Feather-Light**: A minimalist app that's easy on your machine.

## The Backstory üìö

Cobbled together in just 3 days, this app is my humble foray into desktop development ‚Äì no prior experience, just a lot of googling and some help from my code mentor, [Code Mentor GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-zdGAIuWTl-code-mentor) (he even helped with the editing this README). The code might be rough around the edges, and the UI won't win beauty contests, but it gets the job done. If this little tool piques your interest, I'm all in for round two of development. Think object localization, automated actions... the sky's the limit!
